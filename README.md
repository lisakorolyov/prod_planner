# Productivity Planner
The productivity planner is designed to monitor a user's school productivity through analyzing their daily events, and planning additional events accordingly. 
As a React Native application, the user is able to view their events through 3 different lenses: Monthly, Weekly and Daily. 
Consequently, upon adding a new color-coded event, it is automatically added to the appropriate area in the planner along with study and review sessions.
